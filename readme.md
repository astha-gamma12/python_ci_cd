on: push â†’ Run the workflow when you push code to the main branch.

on: pull_request â†’ Run when someone opens a pull request to main.

ðŸš€ It automatically checks your code when you push or open a pull request.


jobs` â†’ A job is a collection of steps that run in the same environment.
- Here, the job is named `build`

Inside the job, you define **steps** â€” what should actually be done (e.g., checkout code, install Python, run tests).

### ðŸ”§ Step 1: Checkout the code

```yaml
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4



      yaml
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
This downloads your code from the GitHub repository so the runner can work with it.





CI is used to automatically test your code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
